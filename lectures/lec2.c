/*
lowest level function: getchar setchar
going to right AtoI and ItoA functions ... ASCII to INT or INT to ASCII

printf and scanf are the highest level


%d is decimal integer, ints
%f is floating point, floats and doubles
%s is character string, strings
%c is character, chars


scanf always requires the addess of the variable going into it!!!!
ex.. 
	int i;
	scanf("%d", &i);


*** static makes a global variable local to the file it is in ***


switch is way faster than if/else!!
